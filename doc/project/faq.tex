I. Why I was disappointed with InnerCore?

1. Bad, old and "legacy" InnerCore API.
2. Better world structure on Minetest - cubic chunks and bigger height.
3. Proprietary.
4. Almost abandoned

II. How similar is it to GregTech?

Pretty similar, but much things has been changed for realism, flexibility and ideas inspired by some software.
