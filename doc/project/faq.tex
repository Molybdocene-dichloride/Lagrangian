    \begin{enumerate}
    \item I. Why I was disappointed with InnerCore?

    1. Bad, old and "legacy" InnerCore API. \\
    2. Better world structure on Minetest - cubic "blocks" and "chunks" and bigger height. \\
    3. Proprietary. \\
    4. Almost abandoned

    \item II. How similar is it to GregTech?

    Pretty similar, but much things has been changed for realism, flexibility and ideas inspired by some software.

    \item III. Why I no GregTech?
    
    Unique mods for InnerCore rare and not usable.
